1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:
    * Making coffee;

FUNCTION makeCoffee

IF NOT enough water in the coffee machine THEN
    ADD water
END IF
    Turn the coffee machine on
    Add coffee beans
    Brew coffee

END FUNCTION




    * Washing dishes;

FUNCTION doDishes

WHILE dirty dishes in sink >= 1
    Take dish from sink
    Soap dish
    Rinse dish
    Put dish on drier rack
ENDWHILE

END FUNCTION

  * Getting Kitten ready for adoption

FUNCTION readyForAdoption

IF kitten weight >= 5 lbs && kitten age >= 2 months
    Call spayOrNeuter surgery
    Add to adoptable list
ELSE
    RETURN kitten is not ready
END IF

END FUNCTION



2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

a. Starbucks - created algorithm to have all their stores have layout with a purpose. When a Starbucks barista makes coffee everything is within reach to minimize moves and steps they have to make to save time.
b. Netflix - make algorithm that give users similar content suggestions based on what the user have watched before.
c. Google assistant or amazon eco dot- the voice activated assitants created algorithm that allow the user to control their electronic devices at home such as Roomba vacuums or TV with a simple voice command.


3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

An efficient algorithm has clear and simple steps that minimize errors and maximize speed. Inefficient algorithm has steps that are not clear and  unnecessary.
